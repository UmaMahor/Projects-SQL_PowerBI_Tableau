## About Data
Post-pandemic, following the impact of COVID-19, tech companies worldwide faced economic slowdowns. This dataset was sourced from reports on tech layoffs published by platforms such as Bloomberg, the San Francisco Business Times, TechCrunch, and The New York Times.

## Project Objective
This data comes from global layoffs and includes details such as company name, location, industry, number of layoffs, date, etc. Since we have a large amount of information, we will first clean the data, and then use it for data exploration to identify trends and patterns.

## Data Cleaning Steps:

- Remove duplicates
- Standardize the data
- Identify and handle null or blank values
- Remove any irrelevant columns

## Data Exploration Steps:

- Identify trends and patterns
- Run complex queries
