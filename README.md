## About Data
Post-pandemic, following the impact of COVID-19, tech companies worldwide faced economic slowdowns. This dataset was sourced from reports on tech layoffs published by platforms such as Bloomberg, the San Francisco Business Times, TechCrunch, and The New York Times.

## Project Objective
The data was exported to an Excel file, and at first glance, it was nearly impossible to draw any conclusions due to the disorganized and unreadable format.
I created a Power BI project to visualize the survey results, making it easier to understand and saving time that would otherwise be spent scrolling through the Excel file.
