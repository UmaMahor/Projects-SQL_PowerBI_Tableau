This data was collected from a survey conducted for data professionals on LinkedIn. First, I used Power Query Editor to transform the data, then created visualizations, finalized the dashboards, and designed a unique theme with a distinct color scheme.

Here are the questions I aimed to answer:

1.	Count of survey participants, average age, and average salary by job title
2.	Preferred programming language based on job title
3.	Perceived difficulty in breaking into the data analytics field
4.	Job satisfaction of data professionals regarding work-life balance and salary

   
The steps I followed to create my analysis were:

1.	Used Power Query to transform the data
2.	Added a custom column and created a formula
3.	Utilized various types of visualizations such as cards, tables, tree maps, column charts, bar charts, and donut charts
4.	Worked on the dashboard, adjusted the background, selected themes, and customized them

   
Here are my key takeaways:

1.	The majority of data professionals preferred Python as their favorite programming language
2.	24.76% of data professionals found it difficult to break into the data industry
3.	Data scientists had the highest salaries compared to other profiles
4.	Most of the data professionals were not happy with their salary
