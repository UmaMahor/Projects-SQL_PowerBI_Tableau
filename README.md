# HR Dashboard Overview | Details
## About Data
The data was downloaded from an open-source website. The author of the website generated this dataset using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. It simulates employee information commonly found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The dataset is designed to closely resemble real-world HR data.

## Project Objective
The dataset is quite large and nearly impossible to read and understand in an Excel file. The project is based on a scenario where an HR manager has this data in its raw format and wants to transform it into an easy-to-understand, comprehensive visual dashboard. This dashboard would allow the HR manager to analyze human resources data, offering both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for deeper analysis.
