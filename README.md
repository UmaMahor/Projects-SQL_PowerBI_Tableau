# Data Professionals Survey Dashboard
## About Data
A survey was conducted among data professionals to gain insights into life in the data analysis industry. It aimed to explore the most popular programming languages, work-life balance, salary satisfaction, various job titles, gender ratios, the challenges of entering the industry as a newcomer, average age, and more. The survey received responses from professionals not only in Canada but from various regions around the world.

## Project Objective
The data was exported to an Excel file, and at first glance, it was nearly impossible to draw any conclusions due to the disorganized and unreadable format.
I created a Power BI project to visualize the survey results, making it easier to understand and saving time that would otherwise be spent scrolling through the Excel file.
